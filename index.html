            Hello, my name is Jennifer Zavala. I am 25 years old, ready to learn everything about coding to make a career out of it. I currently work at Target Wearhouse in Shafter, CA. I like my job there but I feel like I can do better in my life. As of now coding has been nice to me and is getting me excited about this new change. I really don't know much about coding but I'm willing to put the effort into it so I can understand it as I go. I am a mom of two beautful kids, Roman and Aria. In my free time I love to play with my kids as much as I can, because I feel like they are growing to fast.
            <br>
            <br>
            As the class progresses, I have learned a lot of new things. Sometimes it is to much to take in but I take time to myself so I won't get stressed out. Working with the classmates is the best part of the class because I get to know them and makes me feel welcomed into a new enviorment. It helps me step out my comfort zone and ask question to things I don't understand. If I get hired into your company I will make sure everyone feels welcomed and not afraid to ask questions. Well share the knowledge I am receiving from the class.
